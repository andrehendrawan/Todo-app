# Task #2: Classify the features of the todo app

## Must-Have Features
### 1. Task Management (Add, Edit, Delete)
**Explanation**The core functionality of any to-do app is the ability to manage tasks efficiently. Without this, the app wouldn't serve its primary purpose.

### 2. Due Dates and Deadlines
**Explanation**: Due dates are essential for keeping track of when tasks need to be completed, helping users prioritize and stay organized.

### 3. Task Prioritization
**Explanation**: Prioritization allows users to focus on the most important tasks, making it a critical feature for effective task management.

### 4. Cross-Platform Syncing
**Explanation**: Syncing across multiple devices ensures that users can access their tasks from anywhere, which is crucial for maintaining productivity.

### 5. Reminders/Notifications
**Explanation**: Reminders help users stay on top of their tasks, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

## Nice-to-Have Features

### 1. Labels/Tags for Task Categorization
**Explanation**: Labels allow for better organization of tasks, but while helpful, they are not essential for basic task management.

### 2. Collaboration/Task Sharing
**Explanation**: Collaboration is useful for team projects, but not everyone requires this feature for personal task management.

### 3. Recurring Tasks
**Explanation**: Recurring tasks are convenient for regularly scheduled tasks, but they are not a dealbreaker if absent.

### 4. Task Comments and Attachments
**Explanation**: Adding comments or attaching files to tasks can enhance detail and context but isn't necessary for basic task completion.

### 5. Integrations with Other Apps (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack)
**Explanation**: Integrations streamline workflow for power users, but the app can still function well without them.

## Unnecessary Features

### 1. Custom Themes and Colors
**Explanation**: Customization of the app’s appearance is nice for personalization but doesn’t affect the app's performance or usability.

## Missing Features

### 1. Time Tracking
**Explanation**: A built-in time tracking feature would be beneficial for users who want to monitor how much time they spend on tasks, helping to improve time management.

### 2. Advanced Reporting/Analytics
**Explanation**: Offering detailed insights and reports on task completion, time spent, and productivity trends could help users analyze and optimize their workflow.
